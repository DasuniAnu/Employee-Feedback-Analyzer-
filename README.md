📌 Project Overview


It is a multi-agent AI system designed to analyze employee feedback by leveraging:

Large Language Models (LLMs)

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Information Retrieval (IR)

Security mechanisms (authentication, input sanitization, encryption)

Agent Communication Protocols (API-based interaction between agents)

The system demonstrates agentic AI behavior where multiple specialized agents collaborate to extract insights from employee feedback, ensuring Responsible AI practices such as fairness, transparency, and data protection.

🤖 Agents in the System

Sentiment & Urgency Agent

Classifies feedback sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).

Identifies urgency levels (critical, moderate, low).

Theme Extraction Agent

Uses NLP to detect recurring themes (e.g., workload, communication, management, work-life balance).

Summarizes employee concerns into structured topics.

Suggestion Agent

Generates actionable recommendations for HR/management.

Aligns suggestions with Responsible AI guidelines (avoiding bias, ensuring fairness).

🔐 Responsible AI & Security Features

Fairness → Avoid biased interpretations of employee opinions.

Transparency → Explainable classification and decision-making process.

User Data Protection → Input sanitization and optional encryption for sensitive data.

Authentication → Secured access to the system for authorized users.

🏗️ System Architecture

Frontend/UI → Allows HR/admins to input and review employee feedback results.

Backend (Python/Flask/FastAPI) → Handles agent communication and feedback processing.

Agents → Independent modules communicating via defined API protocols.

Database/Storage → Stores anonymized feedback data and analysis results.
